The abstract.txt file contains the abstracts of the _Academy of Management Journal_ from 1966 until early 2017.
Each scientific paper published in this journal has an abstract describing the content of the paper.
Can you tell me how topics studied in this journal evolved over time?
What type of theories or organisational issues where most studied in each decades in which this journal was published?
You can use the open book [Text Mining with R](http://tidytextmining.com/) for inspiration.
