## Challenge 1: The one with the portfolio

The code in the folder called trading should (with a bit of fiddling around) allow you to download price information for securities traded on the London Stock Exchange.

The challenge is simple: collect data on securities and tell us which securities we should be keeping an eye on and why.

You should provide: 

- code that compute summary variables on securities and 
- a written rationale as to why the variables you are using are useful to determine which securities to choose to invest in or to avoid
- both of those should be in an .Rmd file (which compiles).

The TA's and I will look at all the submissions and determine which one wins the challenge for this week.

Good luck!
