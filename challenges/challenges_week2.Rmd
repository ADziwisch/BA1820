## Challenge: The one with the political attitude

Use the survey of political attitude data to explore how attitudes have changed over time (the data is in the political_attitude folder in the exercise folder, the data dictionary is in the UKDA-7404-tab/mrdoc/allissue folder).
What are the main change in the base of the different UK political parties over the different waves of the survey?
You should aim to tell a story with the data. For example, do support vary by gender? What characteristics of supporters of specific parties shift over time? Anything interesting you can tell me about the _profile_ of voters of specific parties?
For this challenge, you need to turn in a .Rmd file that compiles, including both text, tables and figures that you generate with R code.
