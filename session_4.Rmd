# Statistics

## Expected values | Definition

The expected value of a random variable $X$, denoted $E(X)$ is a weighted average of all possible values of $X$, with weights determined by the probability density function.

The expected value is also sometimes denoted $\mu X$ or $\mu$, and called the _population mean_.

## Expected value for a discrete variable
$$
E(X) = x_1 f(x_1) + x_2 f(x_2) + ... + x_k f(x_k) \equiv \sum_{j = 1}^k x_j f(x_j)
$$
Where $x_i$ is any value taken by $X$ and $f(x)$ is the pmf of $X$

## Expected value for a continuous variable

$$
E(X) = \int_{- \infty}^\infty x f(x) dx
$$

## Example: a die

A standard die has 6 faces numbered 1 to 6. If it is fair, each face has a probability of $\frac{1}{6}$ of coming up

What is the expected value of such a die?


## Properties of expected values

- The expected value of a constant is the constant itself

- If for random variables $X$ and $Y$, $X \le Y$ then $E(X) \le E(Y)$

- The expected value operator is linear, in the sense:
$$
\begin{aligned}
  E[X + c] &=   E[X] + c \\
  E[X + Y] &=   E[X] + E[Y] \\
  E[aX]    &= a E[X]
\end{aligned}
$$

## Mean in R

```{r}
set.seed(356)
vec <- sample(x = 100, replace = TRUE)

mean(vec)

summary(vec)
```


## Mean in R (2)

```{r}
set.seed(356)
vec <- rnorm(100, 5, 5)

mean(vec)

summary(vec)
```

## Mean in R (3)

```{r}
set.seed(356)
vec <- rnorm(1000, 5, 5)

mean(vec)

summary(vec)
```

## Mean in R (4)

```{r}
#set.seed(356)
#vec <- rnorm(1000, 5, 5)
vec <- c(vec, NA)
mean(vec)
mean(vec, na.rm = TRUE)
summary(vec)
```

## Median

The median is another measure of central tendency.

For a continuous variable, the median $m$ is the value such as half of the area under the pdf is on the left of $m$.

For a discrete variable $X$, the median is defined as the middle value among the ordered values of $X$. For example, if $X$ can take values $\{4, 8, 10, 12, 13\}$ 
then the median is $10$. If $X$ takes an odd number of values, there are two medians which are sometimes averaged to get a single value.


## Median in R

```{r}
#set.seed(356)
vec <- rnorm(1000, 5, 5)

median(vec)

```


## Measures of variability


There are two widely used measures of the variability of a random variable: the variance and standard deviation.

The variance is a measure of distance from the mean. It is defined as:

$$
Var(X) \equiv E[(X - \mu)^2]
$$
This is equivalent to $Var(X) = E(X^2) - \mu^2$. Note that variance is sometimes denoted $\sigma^2$.

The standard deviation is the positive square root of the variance:

$$
sd(X) \equiv \sqrt{Var(X)}
$$
It is sometimes denoted $\sigma$.

## Variance and standard deviation in R

```{r}
#set.seed(356)
#vec <- rnorm(1000, 5, 5)

var(vec)

sd(vec)

sd(vec) ^ 2 # sd(vec) ** 2 also works

```


## Standardisation

Standardisation can be useful in numerous situations and it is a common application of the properties of variance and standard deviation.

For a random variable $X$ with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$, let's define:

$$
Z \equiv \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
$$
This new variable $Z$ will have mean $E(Z) = 0$ and standard deviation $\sigma = 1$.

This is sometimes refered to as the _z-transform_ of $X$.


## Skewness 

The skewness is defined as:

$$
E(Z^3) = E[(X - \mu)^3]/ \sigma^3
$$
In other words, it is the third standardised moment of $X$.

If skewness is 0, $X$ is symmetric around 0. If it is negative, the distribution has a longer left tail. If it is positive, it has a longer right tail.


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '70%', fig.retina = NULL, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/Negative_and_positive_skew_diagrams.png')
```

## Kurtosis

Kurtosis is defined as the fourth standardized moment of $X$:

$$
E(Z^4) = E[(X - \mu)^4] / \sigma^4
$$
Larger values of kurtosis indicate that the tail in the distribution of $X$ are thicker.


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '50%', fig.retina = NULL, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/Pearson_type_VII_distribution_PDF.png')
```

## Kurtosis

A distribution with no kurtosis ($E(Z^4)= 0$) is said to be __mesokurtic__.

A distribution with positive kurtosis ($E(Z^4) > 0$) is said to be __leptokurtic__.

A distribution with negative kurtosis ($E(Z^4) < 0$) is said to be __platykurtic__.


## Skew and kurtosis in R | Visual inspection

```{r out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center"}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data.frame(vec), aes(vec)) + geom_density()

```

## Skew and kurtosis in R 

```{r}
library(e1071)
#set.seed(356)
#vec <- rnorm(1000, 5, 5)

skewness(vec)

kurtosis(vec)

```

## Moments

The expectation of a random variable is sometimes called the first moment of this variable.

The variance is the second moment. 

As we have seen, the skewness is the third moment and the kurtosis is the fourth moment of this variable.


## Quantiles

Quantiles are cutpoints dividing the range of probability distribution into intervals with equal probabilities.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '40%', fig.retina = NULL, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/Lqr_with_quantile.png')
```

- The 4-quantiles are called quartiles

- The 10-quantiles are called deciles

- The 100-quantiles are called percentiles.


## Quantiles in R


```{r}
#quartiles
quantile(vec, probs = seq(0, 1, 0.25))
#deciles
quantile(vec, probs = seq(0, 1, 0.1))

```



## Visualising summary statistics

There are many ways to visualise summary statistics. Two are very useful:

- density plot
- boxplot

## Density plot

```{r echo = TRUE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "60%"}
norm_dis <- data.frame(x = rnorm(n = 1000))
ggplot(data = norm_dis, aes(x)) + geom_density()
```

## Boxplot

```{r echo = TRUE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "60%"}
normal_dis <- data.frame(x = "Normal", y = rnorm(n = 1000, 
                                                 mean = 0, sd = 10))
ggplot(data = normal_dis, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_boxplot()
```


# Exploring data

## Opening the Audit of Political engagement data

```{r echo = TRUE}
ape <- read.delim(
  "./data/UKDA-7404-tab/tab/audit_of_political_engagement_1-10_data.tab")
head(ape[, c(1, 3)])

dim(ape)

```

## Simplifying

This is a complex dataset, for our example, let's simplify things a bit by only looking at the last wave of the survey.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr) # for easy filter/selection
library(magrittr) # for the pipe operator
ape <- dplyr::filter(ape, Wave == 10) %>% # Because there is another
# function named filter in the stats package which is also loaded
dplyr::select(q1, rurl, income, anykid, exage, gender)
dim(ape)
```

Now that is more manageable. We are still looking at doing some recoding.

## This is not the 1960s

```{r echo = TRUE}
summary(ape[, 'gender'])
```
This won't do

```{r echo = TRUE}
ape[, 'gender'] <- factor(ape[, 'gender'], levels = c(1, 2), 
               labels = c("Male", "Female"))
```

We need to do the same for q1, rurl, qual, income, anykid.
I do this behind the scene (have a look at the .Rmd)

```{r echo = FALSE}
ape[, 'q1'] <- factor(ape[, 'q1'], levels = c(-99, -91, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 
                                              9, 10, 11, 12, 13), 
               labels = c("Not in wave", "Not answered", "Conservative", 
                          "Labour", "Liberal Democrats", "Scottish Nationalists",
                          "Green Party", "UKIP", "BNP", "Respect", "Other", 
                          "Would not vote", "Undecided", "Refused", "Not able to"))

ape[, 'rurl'] <- factor(ape[, 'rurl'], levels = c(-99, -91, 16, 17), 
               labels = c("Not in wave", "Not answered", "Rural", "Urban"))

ape[, 'income'] <- factor(ape[, 'income'], levels = c(-99, -91, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 
                                              9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17), 
               labels = c("Not in wave", "Not answered", "Up to £4,499", 
                          "£4,500 - £6,499", "£6,500 - £7,499", 
                          "£7,500 - £9,499", "£9,500 - £11,499", 
                          "£11,500 - £13,499", "£13,500 - £15,499", 
                          "£15,500 - £17,499", "£17,500 - £24,999",
                          "£25,000 - £29,999", "£30,000 - £39,999", 
                          "£40,000 - £49,999", "£50,000 - £74,999",
                          "£75,000 - £99,999", "£100,000 or more", 
                          "Don't know", "Refused"))

ape[, 'anykid'] <- factor(ape[, 'anykid'], levels = c(-99, -91, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), 
               labels = c("Not in wave", "Not answered", "Any", "None", 
                          "Refused", "No answer", "Not stated"))

```

ggplot(data = ape, aes(x = q1)) + geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "", y = "Count", title = 
"Which party would you vote for if the general election was tomorrow?") +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(angle= 45, hjust = 1))
```

  theme(axis.text = element_text(angle= 45, hjust = 1))
```

## Gender

```{r echo = TRUE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "70%", eval = TRUE}
ggplot(data = ape, aes(x = gender)) + geom_bar() +
        labs(x = "", y = "Count", title = "What is your gender?")
```

## Gender and voting intention

```{r echo = TRUE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "60%", eval = TRUE}
ggplot(data = ape, aes(x = q1, fill = gender)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
        labs(x = "", y = "Count", 
             title = "Voting intention by gender?") +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(angle= 45, hjust = 1))
```

## Debrief

Think for a second and come up with several issues that would arise if we were to take those graphs to mean anything.
